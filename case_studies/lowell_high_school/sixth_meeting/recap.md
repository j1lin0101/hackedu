#Sixth Meeting Recap

I'm starting to see more discussion and opening up from the members. They are now starting to ACTUALLY
smile and laugh with one another! This is a huge plus now and now we need to keep this up.

This week we had two new female members. We made sure we all introduced ourselves. In the feedback they seemed very 
interested and wanted to come again.

Overall, this week was full of club improvements. I hope we can keep this chill and fun environment.
